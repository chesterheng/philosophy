# Start Your Day

## Summary 

- 5 Ways to Start Your Day from the Morning Routine of Marcus Aurelius

## Key Points

### 1. Greet your mornings with gratitude:

- See each day as a miraculous opportunity to be alive, to experience joy, and to love
- Focus on being grateful for the precious privilege of being alive

### 2. Practice Premeditatio Malorum:

- Negative visualization or anticipating the worst so that we can prepare ourselves for the challenges that lie ahead
- Prepare for the worst in the morning, so you are in a better place to deal with disaster, if and when it does arise during the day

### 3. Practice deliberate discomfort:

- Make life routinely uncomfortable in some way to harden ourselves for the day we may need to live it for real
- Examples include taking cold showers, sleeping on the floor, and avoiding social media to focus on productive work

### 4. Journaling:

- Write your thoughts to reflect on your stoic philosophy and prepare for the day ahead
- Provides a tool to realign with the person you want to be when you feel like you are wandering from that path

### 5. Tackle the most important task first:

- Prioritize your to-do list and complete the important task before anything else
- Get momentum and a sense of accomplishment, which helps in productivity
