# End my evening

## Summary 

- 5 Ways to Start Your Day from the Morning Routine of Marcus Aurelius

## Key Points

1. Eliminate external Stimuli
  - We face constant external stimuli in our modern-day society, so it is important to declutter our brains by eliminating many of the nighttime activities we've become used to and replacing them with new ones that help us disconnect and focus on ourselves
  - A good evening routine should contain something that allows your mind to switch off, such as a guided meditation or mindfulness exercise
2. Get some physical Exercise
  - Physical exercise is important for both physical and mental health, and it can also help us fall asleep faster
3. Review your day 
  - Stoics believed in the importance of daily reflection, reviewing one's actions and choices as a way to become more mindful in general
4. Contemplate your personal sage
  - Contemplating your personal sage or role model can help you align your actions with your values and make you a better person
5. Take a view from above
  - Taking a view from above can help shift our perspective to a level high above ourselves and lessen the burden of our problems
6. Spend time with family
  - Spending time with family is essential for creating strong bonds, love, connections, and relationships among family members
7. Prepare for mornings
  - Preparing for the next day the night before is essential to taking the most advantage of every living moment
